This is my ALX Software engineering work on pointers, arrays and strings
0. A function that concatenates two strings. This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.
1. A  function that concatenates two strings. This function will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes.
2. A function that copies a string.
3. A function that compares two strings.
4. A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5. A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6. A  function that capitalizes all words of a string.
7. A function that encodes a string into 1337.
